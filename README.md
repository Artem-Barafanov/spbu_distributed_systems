# spbu_distributed_systems
This project was developed for the **"Fundamentals of Distributed Systems"** course. It implements a model task featuring:

- Creation of a unified network of devices (prototype "robots" on a map)
  
- Development of a parallel map exploration algorithm for multiple devices
